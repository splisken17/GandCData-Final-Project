# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains:

### run_analysis.R

An R script used to create a set of tidy data, as described in the steps below:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### tidydata.txt

The output of the above analysis; an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### CodeBook.md

Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
